Day 1:

```
Okay so I started Hasking because I was honestly trying to find a
way to reignite a coding spark. I feel so burned out sometimes. I love Python
and I love my job, conceptually, but it's been a while since I felt really excited

Functional Programming used to be my jam in college (jam: the only paradigm I was familiar with, tbh)

But it really was great. And it's good for intensive memory precision stuff like that
ray tracer I really enjoyed building.

Plus, remember that time I proposed pattern matching as an
icebreaker game and realized that was just called "having a conversation?"

Here's Hoping Haskell Spice Lattes are in my future

Sisko would write Haskell
